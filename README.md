# Products_Analysis

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to clean, structure, and analyze e-commerce product data using **Python**, **MySQL**, and **Tableau**.  
The goal is to transform raw CSV data into a structured database, validate data quality, perform exploratory SQL analysis, and visualize insights using an interactive Tableau dashboard.

> **Note:** The original dataset is not included due to licensing and privacy considerations. All queries and analysis are reproducible with your own similar datasets.
